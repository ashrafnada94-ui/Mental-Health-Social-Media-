# Mental-Health-Social-Media-
Project Overview

This project analyzes mental health survey data to identify behavioral and lifestyle factors associated with elevated mental health risk and to build a machine learning model to predict high-risk individuals using validated screening instruments.

The project combines:

Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Interactive Power BI dashboards

Statistical effect size analysis

Machine Learning classification models

Clinically meaningful evaluation metrics

The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end, real-world analytics workflow suitable for healthcare and public health use cases.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Advanced EDA techniques were used to understand distributions, thresholds, and group differences.

Key EDA Methods

Group comparisons (High_Risk vs Low_Risk)

Percentile threshold analysis (e.g., 80th percentile of screen time)

Pivot table analysis for subgroup patterns

Effect size analysis using Cohen’s d

Correlation and interaction exploration

Key Findings

Sleep duration showed a large effect size (Cohen’s d ≈ -0.8)
→ High-risk individuals sleep substantially less than low-risk individuals

Screen time showed nonlinear risk behavior
→ Risk increases sharply beyond upper percentiles (e.g., 80th percentile)

Physical activity and sleep emerged as strong protective factors

Tools 
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Power BI
